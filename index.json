In my PhD time, I mainly worked on learning latent variable models for NLP problems and ML problems.\nSpotlight of our recent work:\n Knowledge distillation for learning multilingual models: structure-level KD, structural KD. Improving sequence labeling methods: designing powerful potential functions, speeding up CRF training \u0026amp; inference. Leveraging source models to improve cross-lingual ability: risk minimization, multi-view learning, word reordering. Incorporating various kinds of knowledge to improve NER, sequence labeling and structured prediction: embedding combination, ACE, retrieval guided learning. Unsupervised grammar induction: first neural-based unsupervised parser, discriminative autoencoder, 2nd order parsing, EACL tutorial and empirical study. Multi-view learning for NER, entity linking and cross-lingual learning.  We have some research intern positions available in Alibaba DAMO Academy.
